# kindle-clips

Process your kindle clips into formatted text, org-mode entries or JSON objects.

## Usage

Use your Kindle 'My Clippings.txt' file as input.

CARE! Using the `-o FILE` or `--output FILE` option will overwrite the given
FILE, without confirmation. This should change in the short term as is not
forgiving to user mistakes.

```

## About

Made this tool to learn the Python language and its standar library. I have made
some tests at unit and integration level. But some e2e testing is lacking.

To run tests install the 'pytest' library in the usend VENV and use `$ pytest
test\_kindle\_clips.py`. Using `pytest` alone or adding options such as `$
pytest -v test_kindle_clips.py` is currently giving error messages.
